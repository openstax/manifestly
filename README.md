# Manifestly

Manifestly helps you manage complicated deployments involving multiple sites and git repositories.

## Installation

Manifestly is run as a standalone executable.  Install with:

`gem install manifestly`

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install manifestly

## Usage

manifestly create --search_paths=..

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To run manifestly like an end user eventually will, run:

```
exe/manifestly <OPTIONS AND ARGS HERE>
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
